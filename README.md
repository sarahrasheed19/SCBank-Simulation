CSC 450 Final Project - Carina Caraballo and Sarah Rasheed

Welcome to Sarah and Carina Bank Incorporated! In our ATM BankSimulation App, you can view your current account number, view your current account balance, deposit money, or withdraw money. Once you are done accessing your account, you can sign out.

First you enter your username, and the username gets checked to see if it exists. If it doesn't, you will be prompted to reenter a correct username.

You will then be prompted to enter a password. If the password isn't correct, you will be prompted to enter a password until it is correct. Once it is correct, you will have access to your account.

The options are as follows:
- View current account number (enter "0")
- View current account balance (enter "1")
- Deposit money (enter "2")
- Withdraw money (enter "3")
- Sign out (enter "4")
